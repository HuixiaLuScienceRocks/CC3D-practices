1. Folder new_simulation_cc3d_01_31_2025_16_52_40_c61075 is about CellSort
2. In this practice I am trying to generate restart files so I can continue running the CC3D simulation from a checkpoint
3. Ticking "Allow multiple restart snapshots" will allow generating multiple checkpoint files
4. in setup.png you can see by setting the correct path, we can generate the restart files and energy.log files correctly which gave me problems at the beginning. Please make sure they are inconsistent
